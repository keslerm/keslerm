# Hi I'm Morgan

I've done work as a DevOps engineer, systems engineer, cloud architect and software engineer. I have a passion for bringing DevOps principals in to facilitate systems automation and reliability by leveraging the fantastic tools provided by the FOSS community.

I am a big SaltStack advocate and love to talk about it, probably more than most people feel like listening to.

## Things I've Worked On

* IoT platform using AWS IoT with more than 250k devices globally
* Geo-distributed SaltStack infrastructure, which includes running minions in very terrible environments.
* Kubernetes clusters of many shapes and sizes, including it's various clones like MicroK8s and Rancher's k3s
* Built multiple cloud infrastructure's using super cool tools like Terraform and Pulumi
